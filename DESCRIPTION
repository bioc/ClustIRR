Description: ClustIRR is a quantitative method for clustering of immune cell 
    receptor repertoires (IRRs). The algorithm of ClustIRR finds groups of 
    T or B cell receptors (TCRs or BCRs) that likely have similar specificity. 
    This is achieved by comparing the global and local sequence features of 
    complementarity determining regions (CDRs). Once the specificity groups 
    are identified in a set of IRRs, the algorithm performs quantitative 
    comparison of the cluster structures and their properties between 
    biological conditions.
