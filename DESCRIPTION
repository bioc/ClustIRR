Description: ClustIRR is a quantitative method for clustering of immune  
    receptor repertoires (IRRs). The algorithm identifies groups of T or B cell 
    receptors (TCRs or BCRs) that likely have similar specificity by comparing 
    their sequences. Finally, ClustIRR uses graphs to visualize the specificity 
    structures of IRRs.
