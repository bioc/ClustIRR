# ClustIRR: Clustering of Immune cell Receptor Repertoires (IRRs). 

ClustIRR is a quantitative method for clustering of immune cell 
receptor repertoires (IRRs). The algorithm of ClustIRR finds groups of 
T or B cell receptors (TCRs or BCRs) that likely have similar specificity. 
This is achieved by comparing the global and local sequence features of 
complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) as proposed in [1,2]. Once the 
specificity groups are identified in a set of IRRs, the algorithm performs 
quantitative comparison of the cluster structures and their properties 
between biological conditions. 

TODOs:

1) graphical abstract

2) soon will be submitted to Bioconductor, provide link

3) How to use?, provide link to vignette
