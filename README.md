# ClustIRR: Clustering of Immune Receptor Repertoires (IRRs). 

ClustIRR is a quantitative method for clustering of immune receptor 
repertoires (IRRs). The algorithm of ClustIRR finds groups of T or B 
cell receptors (TCRs or BCRs) that likely have the same antigen specificity. 
This is achieved by comparing global and local sequence features of the 
complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of TCRs and BCRs as proposed in 
[1,2]. Once the specificity groups are identified in a set of IRRs, the algorithm 
performs quantitative comparison of the cluster structure abundances and their
properties between biological conditions. 

TODOs:

1) graphical abstract

2) soon will be submitted to Bioconductor, provide link

3) How to use?, provide link to vignette
